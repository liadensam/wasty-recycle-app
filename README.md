## How does this app work?

- Any button you click will redirect you to the map.
- At the map you can choose categories matching the rubbish you need to recycle.
- After your selection is done, the map will show you stations with these materials. If you click on one of the stations, pop-up will appear informing you about particular bins at that station.
- You can select the station you like and get the destination page overview with detailed information and button for getting directions to your google map.
- The “find” button goes directly to the nearest recycle station to your current location.
- For more information click on menu where you can read about tips how to recycle, what goes to each category and much more about our app.

## APIs

We were working on an application that is aiming to include more people into recycling process and make the recycle easier for the user at the same time. We were using Reykjavik city open data API (https://data-reykjavik.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/endurvinnslug%C3%A1mar/api) and mapbox API.

Our app is made for the phone primary, as for now it is bette if you look at it through a dev tools through a phone screen size. We are working on responsivity right now, it will be updated here when it is done.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
